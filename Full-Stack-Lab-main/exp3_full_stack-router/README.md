# EXP 3: React Router Implementation (Vite + React)

This experiment demonstrates the implementation of **client-side routing** in a React application using **React Router DOM**.  

The project includes multiple pages such as **Home, About Me, Profile, Contact Me, and Skills**, with navigation handled through a reusable **Navbar component**.
